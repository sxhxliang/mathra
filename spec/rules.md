# Reading and layout rules

Every rule has a stable id. The code cites the id where the rule is applied (`crates/core/src/rules.rs`), the matching test starts with the same id (`crates/core/tests/rules.rs`), and `mathra --explain` lists the rules that changed the result.

Prefixes: `L` layout and locale, `S` speech and SVG output (see `svg.md`), `D` determinism, `E` recovery from invalid input (see `tolerance.md`). The ids keep their original Portuguese abbreviations (`ESP` spacing, `LET` letters, `ENT` input, `CONTA` arithmetic).

## Numbers

### L-NUM-1 · Decimal comma in the input

In the languages that write a decimal comma (pt-BR, es, fr, de, it, ru, id, tr, nl, pl), a comma directly between two digits is a decimal separator: `3,14` is the number 3.14.

A comma followed by a space is still a list separator: `f(1, 5)` has two arguments.

A dot between digits is decimal in every locale, because that is the LaTeX convention: `3.14` is 3,14 in pt-BR and 3.14 in en.

In **en, zh, ja, ko, hi and ar**, the comma is never decimal.

The number is kept in the tree in canonical form, with a dot: `{"type":"number","value":"3.14"}`.

> A consequence to know about: in pt-BR, `f(1,5)` has **one** argument (1.5). For two, write `f(1, 5)` or `f(1; 5)`.

### L-NUM-2 · How the number is written in the output

The decimal separator drawn comes from the locale, not from the input. The same `3.14` comes out as `3,14` in every language that writes a decimal comma:

| Decimal | Thousands (L-NUM-3) | Languages |
|---|---|---|
| `.` | `,` | en, zh, ja, ko, hi, ar |
| `,` | `.` | pt-BR, es, de, it, id, tr, nl |
| `,` | none | fr, ru, pl (they group thousands with spaces, which LaTeX math drops) |

The comma between digits is decimal in the input (L-NUM-1) exactly in the languages that write it.

### L-NUM-3 · Thousands separator written by the author

The locale's thousands separator (table in L-NUM-2) followed by groups of exactly three digits separates thousands. In **pt-BR**, `1.000` is one thousand and `12.345,67` is a bit over twelve thousand; in **en**, the comma plays the same role: `1,000.5`. Indian grouping (`1,00,000`) is not recognized. The number is stored without the separator (`"value":"1000"`, `"thousands":"."`) and drawn the way the author wrote it.

> Why: authors write `5,3\times1.000` meaning 5300. Treating the dot as a decimal point wrote `1,000` and changed the meaning. TeX never changes the text; mathra must not change the meaning.

## Intervals

### L-INT-1 · Open interval with reversed brackets

In **pt-BR, fr, de and it**, where `]a, b[` is the usual notation, a `]` without an operand before it (at the start, or after a relation, operator or punctuation) opens an interval, and a `[` after an operand, in a span already opened with `]`, closes it. `]2, 5[` gets delimiter spacing, and the speech says "abre intervalo … fecha intervalo" (pt-BR), "ouvre l'intervalle … ferme l'intervalle" (fr).

## Units

### L-UNI-1 · siunitx quantities

`\SI{9,8}{\meter\per\second\squared}` and `\qty{…}{…}` write the number, a thin space and the unit in upright letters. Negative exponents (`\per`) become a slash: `m/s²`, and more than one unit in the denominator gets parentheses: `J/(mol·K)`. `\num{…}` groups with thin spaces from five digits on; `\ang{30}` writes `30°`.

### L-UNI-2 · Ranges, lists and products

`\SIrange`/`\qtyrange`, `\numrange` and `\angrange` join the two values with the language's "to", as siunitx's `range-phrase` does: `1 kg to 10 kg` in en, `1 kg a 10 kg` in pt-BR, `1 kg bis 10 kg` in de (the word is `op.–` in the language's file); where the embedded font cannot write that word (zh, ja, ko, hi, ar), with an en dash: `1 kg – 10 kg`. `\SIlist`/`\qtylist`, `\numlist` and `\anglist` separate the values with commas and close with the language's "and" (`1, 2 e 3` in pt-BR); where the embedded font cannot write that word (zh, ja, ko, hi, ar), the last separator is a comma too. `\SIproduct`/`\qtyproduct` and `\numproduct` join with ×. As in siunitx's defaults, the unit is repeated on every value. Options in brackets (`\SI[mode=text]{…}{…}`) are read and ignored; `\qty[…]{…}{…}`, with two arguments in braces after the brackets, is siunitx's, not physics's `\qty[…]`.

### L-UNI-4 · siunitx in text

The siunitx commands work inside `\text{…}` (and every text argument) as in math, as siunitx typesets them in text too: `\text{at \SI{12}{\volt}}` sets the number upright, a thin space and the unit upright. The same holds for `\qty`, `\si`, `\unit`, `\num`, `\ang` and the ranges, lists and products (L-UNI-2).

## Chemistry

### L-UNI-3 · Units spoken by name

The tree keeps the siunitx name of each unit and its prefix (`{"type": "unit", "prefix": "kilo", "name": "gram"}`, drawn `kg`), and the speech says the name: `\SI{9.81}{\meter\per\second\squared}` is "9.81 meters per second squared", "9,81 metros por segundo ao quadrado". `\per` is spoken "per" ("por"), and the parentheses and the dot of a denominator are not read ("joules per mole kelvin"). The last unit before "per" agrees in number with the value: in English only 1 is singular (1 meter, 1.5 meters); in pt-BR, values below 2 are (1,5 metro, 2 metros). Without a value (`\si`) the unit is plural. The names are in the `units` section of the language's file (`locales.md`); a language without it, or a unit it does not name, reads the symbol, as before. The drawing, the text and the braille keep the symbols.

### L-CHE-2 · Structural chemistry (chemfig)

With the `chem` feature (on by default), `\chemfig{…}`, `\schemestart … \schemestop`, `\chemname{…}{…}` and the `\chemmove{…}` that follows them are read as one chemistry node: a graph of atoms and bonds per structure, and the compounds, plus signs, arrows and mechanism arrows of a scheme. The structure is drawn by chemfig's directions with mathra's font and rules for its labels, and read aloud by its molecular formula, counted from the graph, and its rings. The layout, formula and reading rules (C-LAY-n, C-FOR-n, C-SCH-n) are in `spec/chemistry.md`.

### L-CHE-1 · mhchem

`\ce{…}` reads chemical formulas: element symbols upright, digits after them as subscripts, charges as superscripts (`Ag+`, `SO4^2-`, `[H+]`), radicals (`^{.}` → •), oxidation states (`^{II}`), states (`(aq)`, `(s)`, `(l)`, `(g)`), isotopes on an empty base (`^{14}_{6}C`) and bonds (`-`, `=`, `#`, `\bond{…}`), which are drawn as lines and are not read as minus, equals or congruence. Coefficients may be integers, decimals (`0.5`), fractions (`1/2`, drawn small) or math (`$x$`, or a lone lowercase letter); after the dot of a hydrate (`CuSO4.5H2O`, also `*`) a number is a coefficient again, not a subscript. The arrows are `->`, `<-`, `<->` (resonance), `<-->`, `<=>`, `<=>>` and `<<=>`; `[above][below]` right after an arrow are labels, read as `\ce` themselves, and the arrow stretches over them. `\frac{…}{…}` inside `\ce` keeps formulas in numerator and denominator, and any other command (`\Delta`) is read as math. `\pu{123 kJ mol^-1}` writes a quantity with mhchem's unit syntax. Both work inside `\text{…}` (and every text argument) as in math, as mhchem typesets them in text too (`\text{water, \ce{H2O}}`).

## Input coming from other systems

### L-ENT-1 · HTML entities

`&lt;`, `&gt;`, `&amp;`, `&nbsp;`, `&quot;` inside the equation are read as the characters they stand for. They show up when the equation went through an HTML editor.

### L-ENT-2 · Outer delimiters

`$…$`, `$$…$$`, `\(…\)` and `\[…\]` around the whole equation are removed.

### L-ENT-4 · MathML pasted as LaTeX

An input that starts with a `<math>` element (after an optional XML prolog or comments) is read as MathML, even in LaTeX mode: LaTeX never starts that way, and editors put MathML on the clipboard. The other notations are in `input.md`.

### L-ENT-3 · Document package commands

Package imports are ignored and noted:

- `\tiny`, `\scriptsize`, `\small`, `\large` and the rest of the size commands: the size comes from whoever uses the SVG. In text, `\fontsize{size}{skip}\selectfont` too.
- `\usepackage{…}`, `\RequirePackage{…}` and MathJax's `\require{…}`, with their optional argument: the supported packages are already loaded.

### L-TXT-1 · Quotes in text

Inside `\text{…}` (and every text argument), TeX's quote ligatures become typographic quotes: ``` `` ``` → “, `''` → ”, `` ` `` → ‘, `'` → ’. In math mode `'` is still a prime.

### L-TXT-2 · Math inside text

Inside `\text{…}` (and every text argument), these are set as LaTeX sets them:

- `\textsubscript{…}` and `\textsuperscript{…}`: a script of the text before it (`H\textsubscript{2}O`).
- `\ensuremath{…}`: its argument as math, as `$…$` would.
- `\boldmath`: the math that follows (`$…$`, `\(…\)`, `\ensuremath`) is bold, until the end of the group it is in; `\unboldmath` ends it.
- An environment that starts math, up to its `\end`: the displays `equation`, `align`, `gather`, `multline`, `flalign`, `alignat`, `eqnarray`, `displaymath` and `math` (and their `*` forms), read as math like `\[…\]`.
- Math does not end the text's style: in `\textbf{a $x$ b}`, b is bold, as are the letters after math in `\textsc`, `\texttt` and `\bf`, `\scshape`, `\ttfamily` until the end of their group. The math itself is not (that is `\boldmath`).

A math command written in text (`\mathrm{V}`, `\frac{1}{2}`, `\sqrt{2}`) is an error in TeX: strict mode refuses it, and tolerant mode reads it as math, with a warning (E-REC-1). So is an environment TeX allows only in math (`array`, `matrix`, `pmatrix` and the other matrices, `cases`, `aligned`, `gathered`, `split`, `subarray`), read as math up to its `\end`.

### L-TXT-3 · Space inside text

Inside `\text{…}` (and every text argument), `\hspace{…}` and `\hspace*{…}` add a space of that length (`a\hspace{1cm}b`). `\phantom{…}` leaves the room its argument takes, read as text, without drawing it; `\hphantom{…}` keeps only its width and `\vphantom{…}` only its height.

A text is a box of its natural width, as `\text{…}` is in TeX: `\hfill`, `\hfil` and `\hss` take no room in it (`1 \hfill IA` is `1 IA`), and a line break, `\newline` or `\linebreak` (with its optional `[n]`), is a space, as `\\` is.

### L-TXT-4 · Color inside text

Inside `\text{…}` (and every text argument), `\textcolor{color}{…}` sets its argument in that color, and `\color{color}` the rest of the group it is in (`{\color{red}warm} and cold`), with the color models of math (`\color[rgb]{0.2,0.4,0.6}`). The colored text keeps the bold, small capitals or monospace around it, and the math in it is colored too.

### L-TXT-5 · Italic inside text

Inside `\text{…}` (and every text argument), `\textit{…}` and `\emph{…}` set their argument in italic, and `\itshape`, `\it` and `\em` the rest of their group; `\textit{…}` in math is text in italic. Italic text is a text font: its letters sit side by side, with no italic correction between them, nor after a word. After `\textit{…}` and `\emph{…}` comes the italic correction of their last letter, as LaTeX adds it (`\/`), except before a period or a comma. Italic goes on after math in its group, as bold does, and inside a color.

`\mathit{…}`'s font is a text font too: its letters make one word, with no italic correction between them (TeXbook, Appendix G, rule 17), where the math italic of `$ff$` has one after each letter.

## Macros

### L-MAC-1 · Substitution macros

`\newcommand{\name}[n][default]{body}`, `\renewcommand`, `\providecommand`, `\def\name#1#2{body}`, `\let\a\b`, `\DeclareMathOperator{\name}{text}` (and `*`), `\DeclarePairedDelimiter{\name}{open}{close}` (with `*` for `\left…\right`) and `\newenvironment{name}{begin}{end}` apply to the rest of the equation. Expansion replaces `#1…#9` with the arguments and reads the result again. After 2,000 expansions mathra stops: the macro almost certainly calls itself (an error in strict mode; in tolerant mode the excess is discarded with a single E-REC-1 warning).

`\ifx`, `\expandafter`, `\catcode` and `\def` with delimited parameters are deliberately not supported (see `boundary.md`).

Package commands defined through other commands go through the same mechanism: from physics, `\dv`, `\pdv`, `\fdv`, `\dd`, `\eval`, `\expval`, `\mel`, `\braket{a}{b}`, `\ketbra`, `\comm`, `\acomm`, `\pb`, `\grad`, `\divergence`, `\curl`, `\laplacian`, `\vb`, `\vu`, `\va`, `\cross`, `\vdot`, `\order`, `\Tr`, `\tr`, `\rank`, `\erf`, `\Res`, `\qty`, `\pqty`, `\bqty`, `\vqty`, `\Bqty`; `\ket`, `\bra`, `\braket`, `\Set` (braket); `\tensor`, `\indices` (tensor); `\prescript` (mathtools); `\abs`, `\norm`, `\sfrac`, `\nicefrac`, `\unitfrac`. `\qty` is physics' brackets unless two braced groups follow (`\qty{3}{m}`, siunitx's quantity). `\div` stays ÷: physics' divergence is `\divergence`.

## Column arithmetic (mathra extensions)

### L-CONTA-1 · Long division, Brazilian layout

`\divchave{247}{5}` computes the long division and draws it the way Brazilian schools do: dividend on the left, divisor to the right of the bracket, quotient under the divisor, and each step (product with a minus sign, rule, remainder with the next digit brought down) under the dividend. Steps whose product is zero only bring the digit down.

### L-CONTA-2 · Column arithmetic

`\contaarmada{+}{347}{285}` (also `-` and `\times`) aligns the terms on the right, writes the carries at script size above the first term, draws the rule and writes the computed result. When multiplying by a number with more than one digit, the shifted partial products appear before the sum.

## Functions

### L-FUN-1 · Function name by locale

The input accepts LaTeX's English names and the Brazilian ones (`\sen`, `\tg`, `\cotg`, `\cossec`, `\arcsen`, `\arctg`, `\senh`, `\mdc`, `\mmc`). The tree keeps the canonical English name (`sin`). The output writes it in the locale's language: `sin x` in en, `sen x` in pt-BR, es and it, `tg x` in ru, it and pl, `sh x` in fr, `ggT` in de. The names of each language are under `written` in `crates/core/src/locales/<code>.json`.

## Letters

### L-LET-1 · Math italic

Latin letters and lowercase Greek letters are drawn with Unicode's math italic characters (block U+1D400; `h` lives at U+210E). The lowercase Greek variants are lowercase letters too: `\phi` (ϕ), `\epsilon` (ϵ), `\vartheta` (ϑ), `\varkappa` (ϰ), `\varrho` (ϱ) and `\varpi` (ϖ) are in italic, at U+1D716–U+1D71B, as TeX sets them. Uppercase Greek letters stay upright, as in TeX.

### L-LET-2 · Double-struck letters spoken

A double-struck capital, written `\mathbb{R}`, `RR` (AsciiMath), `mathvariant="double-struck"` or as the character (ℝ, 𝔸), is read as the number set it names: ℕ, ℤ, ℚ, ℝ and ℂ are "the natural numbers", "the integers", "the rational numbers", "the real numbers" and "the complex numbers" ("os naturais", "os inteiros", "os racionais", "os reais", "os complexos"). Any other is read as a letter: "double-struck P", "P duplo". Where the language contracts a preposition with the article of the name, the speech does: `x \in \mathbb{R}` is "x pertence aos reais", `A \subset \mathbb{Z}` is "A está contido nos inteiros". The names are in the `double_struck` section of the language's file (`locales.md`); a language without it reads the letter alone, as before.

## Operators

### L-OPR-1 · The dot between vectors

`\cdot` (and physics' `\vdot`) between two vectors is the dot product and is spoken "dot" ("escalar" in pt-BR): `\vec{v} \cdot \vec{w}` is "vector v dot vector w". A vector is a letter with an arrow over it (`\vec`, `\overrightarrow`) or a bold letter (`\mathbf`, `\boldsymbol`, `\vb`), also with an index. Anywhere else the dot is "times" (`2 \cdot 3`, `a \cdot b`, `2 \cdot \vec{v}`). The word is in the `optional` section of the language's file (`locales.md`); a language without it keeps "times". The drawing is the same dot.

## Spacing

### L-ESP-1 · Space between atoms

Every node has a TeX atom class (TeXbook, ch. 17): `ord`, `op`, `bin`, `rel`, `open`, `close`, `punct`. The space between neighbors comes from the table in the TeXbook, ch. 18, in *mu* (1/18 em):

| left \ right | ord | op | bin | rel | open | close | punct | inner |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **ord**   | 0 | 3 | (4) | (5) | 0 | 0 | 0 | (3) |
| **op**    | 3 | 3 | – | (5) | 0 | 0 | 0 | (3) |
| **bin**   | (4) | (4) | – | – | (4) | – | – | (4) |
| **rel**   | (5) | (5) | – | 0 | (5) | 0 | 0 | (5) |
| **open**  | 0 | 0 | – | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| **close** | 0 | 3 | (4) | (5) | 0 | 0 | 0 | (3) |
| **punct** | (3) | (3) | – | (3) | (3) | (3) | (3) | (3) |
| **inner** | (3) | 3 | (4) | (5) | (3) | 0 | (3) | (3) |

3 = thin space, 4 = medium, 5 = thick. Values in parentheses vanish in script style. `–` cannot happen because of L-ESP-2. Fractions, `\left…\right` and matrices with delimiters are of class `inner`.

### L-ESP-2 · An operator without operands becomes ordinary

A `bin` becomes `ord` when it has no operand on the left (start, or after `bin`, `op`, `rel`, `open`, `punct`) or on the right (end, or before `rel`, `close`, `punct`). That is what keeps the minus of `-b` and of `x = -1` attached (TeXbook, Appendix G, rules 5 and 6).

### Grouping braces

As in TeX, an operator alone in braces becomes `ord`: `{,}` is a comma without punctuation spacing.

## Determinism

### D-DET-1 · Same input, same bytes

The same equation, locale, mathra version and embedded font produce identical output, byte for byte. Nothing depends on the clock, on hash order or on the system.

## Two-dimensional layout

The rules for fractions, roots, scripts, limits, accents, bars, braces and arrows follow Appendix G of the TeXbook with the parameters of the font's MATH table, as MathML Core formulates them. Each lives in `crates/core/src/layout/`:

| Structure | MATH table constants used |
|---|---|
| Fraction (`\frac`, `\dfrac`, `\tfrac`) | `FractionNumerator(DisplayStyle)ShiftUp`, `…DenominatorShiftDown`, `…GapMin`, `FractionRuleThickness`, `AxisHeight`; `\nulldelimiterspace` of 0.12 em on each side. A thickness the input gives (`\above`, `\genfrac`) is absolute and sets the clearance as TeX's rule 15d does: 3θ in display style, θ otherwise; 0 draws no rule |
| Binomial | `StackTopShiftUp`, `StackBottomShiftDown`, `StackGapMin` |
| Root | `RadicalVerticalGap`, `RadicalRuleThickness`, `RadicalExtraAscender`, `RadicalKernBefore/AfterDegree`, `RadicalDegreeBottomRaisePercent` |
| Scripts | `SuperscriptShiftUp(Cramped)`, `SubscriptShiftDown`, `…BaselineDrop…`, `SubSuperscriptGapMin`, `SpaceAfterScript`, italic correction |
| Limits (display `\sum`, `\lim`, `\overset`) | `UpperLimitGapMin`, `UpperLimitBaselineRiseMin`, `LowerLimit…` |
| Large operator | variant with height ≥ `DisplayOperatorMinHeight` in display style, centered on the axis |
| Delimiters (`\left`, matrices) | size variants and assembly from parts; height ≥ max(0.901 × 2δ, 2δ − 0.5 em), like `\delimiterfactor` and `\delimitershortfall` |
| Accents | `AccentBaseHeight`, the glyph's accent attachment; `\widehat` and extended arrows through horizontal assembly |
| Matrices and `array` | strut of 0.84 em / 0.36 em per row, columns 1 em apart, `\jot` of 0.3 em in alignments |
| Arrow diagrams (`tikz-cd`, `xymatrix`) | `AxisHeight` (arrows leave and reach each cell at the axis, and the diagram is centered on it), `FractionRuleThickness` (the strokes); tikz-cd's separations: 2.4 em between columns and 2.1 em between rows, widened to fit a label; labels in script style; a bend as tikz's `bend left`, a cubic Bézier with its control points 0.39 of the way along the leaving and arriving directions |

The prime of `f'` uses the ′ glyph at normal size, attached to the base, because it is already drawn as a superscript.

### L-BOX-1 · graphicx boxes

graphicx's box commands set their argument in text mode, and work in math and inside `\text{…}` alike (the CircuiTikZ manual uses them in node labels):

- `\scalebox{h}[v]{…}` scales the box by h across and v up (v is h when left out). A negative h mirrors it inside its own width, as `\reflectbox{…}` does (`\scalebox{-1}[1]`); a negative v turns it upside down, its height becoming its depth. Factors are kept between 0.05 and 20 in size.
- `\resizebox{width}{height}{…}` scales it to that size; `!` for one of them keeps the ratio. `\resizebox*` counts the depth in the height.
- `\rotatebox[origin=…]{angle}{…}` turns it counterclockwise, by degrees, and takes the smallest box around the turned one, as graphicx does. The turn is around the left end of the baseline; `origin` moves that point with graphicx's letters: `l`, `r` across, `t`, `b`, `B` (baseline) up and down, `c` the center; a direction it leaves out is centered (`origin=c`, `origin=lt`).
- `\raisebox{lift}[height][depth]{…}` raises it, then gives it that height and depth, if asked: `\raisebox{0pt}[\height][0pt]{…}` (the manual's `\killdepth`) removes its depth, so labels with and without descenders share a baseline.

The lengths take any TeX unit and the box's own `\width`, `\height`, `\depth` and `\totalheight`, with a factor (`2\height`); in `\raisebox`, those of the raised box. A length that cannot be read is an error in `\raisebox{lift}` and `\resizebox`; in `\raisebox`'s optional arguments it is ignored in tolerant mode (E-REC-9). Turned and unevenly scaled boxes are drawn through an SVG `matrix()` (S-SVG-5).

## Measured coverage

`cargo run --release -p mathra --example bench` runs the hand-written constructions in `corpus/` in both modes and prints how many convert; the README has the numbers of one run. The constructions strict mode refuses are not equations: TeX programming (`\ifx`, `\expandafter`, `\catcode`) and drawings with coordinates (`\tikz`). Strict mode also "accepts" LaTeX escaped twice (`\\cdot`), because it is valid for TeX (a line break followed by the letters "cdot"); tolerant mode reads what the author meant and warns (E-REC-2).

## Proof trees

- **L-PRF-1**: proof branches attach at their conclusions; labels and ancestor widths enlarge the box without shifting that attachment. See [proof trees](proofs.md), tested in `crates/core/tests/proof.rs`.

## Explicit sizes

### L-SIZ-1 · Absolute LaTeX size declarations

In math input, `\tiny`, `\sixptsize`, `\scriptsize`, `\footnotesize`, `\small`, `\normalsize`, `\large`, `\Large`, `\LARGE`, `\huge`, `\Huge` set the remaining group to .5, .6, .7, .8, .9, 1, 1.2, 1.44, 1.728, 2.074, 2.488 times the caller's em. A nested declaration replaces the previous one; it does not multiply it. A declaration resets to text style, including inside a script, as in RaTeX. See [RaTeX command compatibility](ratex-compatibility.md), tested in `tests/ratex_commands.rs` and `tests/rules.rs`.
