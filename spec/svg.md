# The SVG contract

A mathra SVG is an outline drawing that carries the speech, the source and the tree along with it. The default web output follows every item below and has a test in `crates/core/tests/rules.rs`.

```xml
<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:mathra="urn:mathra:1"
     viewBox="0 -645 1730 658" width="1.73em" height="0.658em"
     style="vertical-align: -0.013em"
     role="img" aria-labelledby="mathra-0f561d1c-speech" lang="en" data-mathra-version="1.6.0">
  <title id="mathra-0f561d1c-speech">3.14</title>
  <metadata>
    <mathra:source type="latex">3.14</mathra:source>
    <mathra:tree>{"type":"row","children":[{"type":"number","value":"3.14"}]}</mathra:tree>
    <mathra:braille code="nemeth">⠼⠒⠨⠂⠲</mathra:braille>
    <mathra:font>STIX Two Math</mathra:font>
  </metadata>
  <style>svg:root{color:#111}</style>
  <defs><path id="mathra-0f561d1c-g19" d="…"/> …</defs>
  <g fill="currentColor" transform="scale(1,-1)"><use href="#mathra-0f561d1c-g19" x="0"/> …</g>
  <text … fill="transparent" aria-hidden="true">3.14</text>
</svg>
```

Warnings from tolerant mode go into the metadata as `<mathra:warning rule="E-REC-1">…</mathra:warning>`.

### S-SVG-1 · Size and baseline

Coordinates in font units, with the baseline at y = 0. `width` and `height` in `em`, to follow the size of the surrounding text. `vertical-align` lowers the SVG by its depth, lining up the equation's baseline with the text's.

The view covers the equation's box and every bit of ink that passes it: an SVG clips what falls outside its view, and some ink does pass the box TeX measures (the hook of a bold f at the end of an equation, the tail of ρ at its start, the line of `\cancel`). Where no ink passes, the view is the box, starting at x = 0; where it does, the view starts before 0 or ends after the width by exactly that much, never by a fixed margin.

### S-SVG-2 · Speech

`role="img"` and `aria-labelledby` pointing to a `<title>` with the phrase in the locale's language.

### S-SVG-3 · Recoverable source

`<metadata>` keeps the original input, with its notation in `<mathra:source type="latex|mathml|asciimath">`, the tree of meaning as JSON and the font name. The namespace is `urn:mathra:1`.

### S-SVG-4 · Color

Glyphs use `fill="currentColor"`.

- **Inline in a page**, the SVG inherits the text color, and the page theme applies.
- **As a standalone document** (`<img>`, an opened file), `svg:root` matches and applies a fixed dark ink (`#111`).

A `<style>` inside an inline SVG applies to the whole page. That is why the only rule is `svg:root`, which does not match when the SVG is inside HTML.

> **Open decision.** Inside `<img>`, the image does not know the page theme. Following `prefers-color-scheme` made the equation almost invisible on a light page with the system in dark mode (Chrome). A `--theme` option may come later.

### S-SVG-5 · Each glyph drawn once

Each glyph becomes a `<path>` in `<defs>`, in order of first appearance, and is reused with `<use>`. A turned or unevenly scaled box (`\rotatebox`, `\scalebox{2}[1]`, L-BOX-1) is a `<g transform="matrix(…)">` around its drawing; its glyphs are in `<defs>` like the others.

### S-SVG-6 · Text layer

A transparent `<text>`, stretched with `textLength` over the width of the equation, holding the linear text (`3.14 + x`). When the SVG is inline in the page, selection and find-in-page pick up this text. Inside `<img>`, nothing is selectable: that is a browser rule.

### S-SVG-7 · Unique ids per equation

Ids (`…-speech`, `…-g19`) start with a prefix derived from the input, the locale and the version (32-bit FNV-1a). Several equations on one page do not clash, and the same equation always gets the same ids (D-DET-1).

### S-SVG-8 · Always valid XML

All text that comes from outside (source, speech, linear text, warnings, colors) is escaped for `& < > "`. Characters XML 1.0 cannot take even when escaped (control characters from U+0000 to U+001F except tab, LF and CR, plus U+FFFE/U+FFFF) become U+FFFD. Without this, a `\0` pasted into the input made the SVG unreadable for every browser.

### S-SVG-9 · Braille

`<metadata>` also keeps the equation in braille, as Unicode braille cells, with its code: `<mathra:braille code="cmu|nemeth">`. A braille display or an app can read it without converting the equation again. What each code covers is in `braille.md`.

### S-SVG-10 · Steps and the writing animation

Off by default; without them the SVG is the same, byte for byte.

- **Steps** (`steps`, `--steps`): each glyph, rule, line and ellipse carries `data-step="k"`, from 0, in the order the layout set it (numerator before denominator, the content before the delimiters it measured), and the `<svg>` carries `data-steps` with the count. No CSS: a page can walk through the equation itself, showing the elements whose step is below k.
- **Animation** (`animate`, `--animate`, steps included): the equation writes itself, with CSS alone, in that order. A glyph fades in; a rule grows along its length (a wide one from the left, a tall one from the top); a line or an ellipse (`\cancel`, `\phase`, `\textcircled`) is drawn along its length (`pathLength="1"`). The whole equation takes about three seconds: the interval between two steps is 3 s divided by their count, at most 0.15 s. Each element carries its index (`style="--i:k"`) and the `<svg>` the interval (`--mr-step`): the `<style>` itself is the same in every equation, since an inline SVG's style applies to the whole page, and two animated equations on one page must not change each other's timing. With `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` nothing moves.

## Native image variant

`render_svg` uses the same glyph paths, source/speech/tree/braille metadata and ink bounds, with explicit native-image variants of S-SVG-1 (absolute logical dimensions, including the baseline), S-SVG-4 (an explicit foreground) and S-SVG-6 (no transparent text layer). See [native image output](native-svg.md). The default `convert` and public `output::svg::generate` contracts are unchanged.
